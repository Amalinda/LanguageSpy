The one-inch-HF-to-VHF-converter directory contains an entry for the [2015 Hackaday.io One Square Inch competition](https://hackaday.io/project/7813-the-square-inch-project), an HF receive converter for VHF receivers like the RTL SDRs or similar.

The UKHASnet-Pi directory contains a board to allow the [HopeRF RFM69](http://www.hoperf.com/rf_transceiver/modules/RFM69HW.html) RF modules to be interfaced to a Raspberry Pi. It can be used for experimenting with [UKHASnet](https://ukhas.net/).
